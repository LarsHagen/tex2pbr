Version 0.1.0, Open Beta, Copyright 2017

Hello, and thank you for downloading the beta version of TEX2PBR!
This plugin was developed with Unity 5.5 on Windows and is untested on other platforms and unity versions.

How to use: 
 Go to Window->TEX2PBR, then place your input texture in the 'Input Image' field and wait for the program to do it's initial work. When done, use the settings to the right to tweak the output and click Export when you are happy with the result. Thats it!

Tips and Tricks:
 - Use textures for input that are evenly lit (no sharp light coming in from the sides).
 - Don't use .tif textures for input. It doesn't work yet.
 - Use textures for input that already tile seamlessly.
